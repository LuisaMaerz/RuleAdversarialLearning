# RuleAdversarialLearning

Thought experiment for rule/pattern adversarial learning.

Goal is to make nets learn more independent from certain rules/patterns.

Currently JointModel is used for the experiment, you can ignore the others. There are several methods in the files that are not used here, but are used in the experimental setup with TACRED relation extraction data.
